# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

I have drafted up my story outline on Shorthand. I have inputed each section and included a few images and data visualizations.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

My target audience are fresh college graduates, primarily in the Pittsburgh region, but it can be for any college graduate. I am focusing on Pittsburgh for my data collection in regards to rent, groceries, etc. But any college graduate can read through the story and use the salary calculator at the end. 

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

Goals:
- see if the story is cohesive and flows correctly
- see if the topic is interesting to people
- determine if the call to action is clear and reasonable

Questions to ask:
- what is the article about?
- would you read this article?
- what is the goal of the article?
- is there anything confusing or you don't understand?
- Any additional comments?


## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

Interviews:
1. MISM, 23
2. BIDA, >25
3. MAM, >25

Findings:
- The audience was a little too broad and was a little mismatched. Originally my project was about what the middle class salary should be in Pittsburgh and the United States. It was brought up that the middle class in Pittsburgh contains more families and those who have been in the workforce for a few years already. My data, however, contained information about salaries for college graduates, rent costs, and a call to action geared towards single family households.
- The interviewees did find the topic interesting, they all really enjoyed (well not enjoyed, they were more in disbelief) of the salary inflation visualization.
- The topic was clear to everybody as well.
- In regards to the goal of the article, most said that it was to give people better salary expectations. That is one intended goal of the article but not the only takeaway.


# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

Changes for part 3:
- I have already changed the audience and overarching topic of my article to narrow down the audience and make the data more cohesive with the story.
- I will make the call to action section more clear that the readers don't have to find jobs with higher salaries. I want them to feel like they have the power to make do with their salary and make small changes in their lifestyle to be able to do more with their money. 


**Final thoughts:**

I feel like I have a pretty good idea on where to go for my final part of the project. I know how to make my story more cohesive and to have a clearer call to action. I am glad that the story is easy to understand and is a topic that people are interested in.
