# Wireframes / storyboards

I have drafted up my story outline on Shorthand. I have all of the headers for each section without the text, and put in most of the data visualizations.

# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience are fresh college graduates, primarily in the Pittsburgh region, but it can be for any college graduate. I am focusing on Pittsburgh for my data collection in regards to rent, groceries, etc. But any college graduate can read through the story and use the salary calculator at the end. 

## Interview script

Goals:
- see if the story is cohesive and flows correctly
- see if the topic is interesting to people
- determine if the call to action is clear and reasonable

Questions to ask:
- what is the article about?
- would you read this article?
- what is the goal of the article?
- is there anything confusing or you don't understand?
- Any additional comments?


## Interview findings

Interviews:
1. MISM, 23
2. BIDA, >25
3. MAM, >25

Findings:
- The audience was a little too broad and was a little mismatched. Originally my project was about what the middle class salary should be in Pittsburgh and the United States. It was brought up that the middle class in Pittsburgh contains more families and those who have been in the workforce for a few years already. My data, however, contained information about salaries for college graduates, rent costs, and a call to action geared towards single family households.
- The interviewees did find the topic interesting, they all really enjoyed (well not enjoyed, they were more in disbelief) of the salary inflation visualization.
- The topic was clear to everybody as well.
- In regards to the goal of the article, most said that it was to give people better salary expectations. That is one intended goal of the article but not the only takeaway.


# Identified changes for Part III

Changes for part 3:
- I have already changed the audience and overarching topic of my article to narrow down the audience and make the data more cohesive with the story.
- I will make the call to action section more clear that the readers don't have to find jobs with higher salaries. I want them to feel like they have the power to make do with their salary and make small changes in their lifestyle to be able to do more with their money. 


**Final thoughts:**

I feel like I have a pretty good idea on where to go for my final part of the project. I know how to make my story more cohesive and to have a clearer call to action. I am glad that the story is easy to understand and is a topic that people are interested in.
