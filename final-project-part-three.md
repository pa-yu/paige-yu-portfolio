# The final data story
[Final Product](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/telling-stories-with-data-final-project/index.html)


# Changes made since Part II

I have added all of the information for each section. For the budget calculator, I decided to link to a website with a built in calculator because I couldn't figure out how to do an inputtable form on shorthand. 

## The audience

The audience for my final story are primarily for fresh college graduates living in Pittsburgh. However, it is also open to all college graduates because they can use the information to create their own budget and calcualte their salary. As I mentioned in part 2, the interviews helped me shift my audience from middle class families to college graduates. 

## Final design decisions

For the design of my story, I decided to stick closely with the template I used, I like the sections it provided and how the story is broken down. I spent a bit of time finding an order that allowed the story to flow well and made sense to readers. There were a couple of iterations but I ended up with the story I have now.

## References

Already in Shorthand.

## AI acknowledgements

I used chatpgt to help come up with some suggestions on lifestype changes the reader can make, although I only ended up using two of them and came up with the rest myself. I also used it to help me make the budget breakdowns categories and provide rough estimates on each category. I then double checked those estimates with outside references. 

# Final thoughts

I liked the ease of creating a website through Shorthand but I felt like it was limiting. There were many things that I wanted to do but didn't know how or Shorthand didn't have the capability to. For example, I wanted to have an actual form for the "Calculate your own salary expectations" section that readers can type into but Shorthand didn't have that ability so I had to link to an outside source. I felt like Shorthand had a larger learning curve than I expected and it was dificult learning how to use Shorthand while also trying to do my project on it. The two blue bars at the end of my story I still can't figure out how to delete after many attempts to. Also Shorthand was very laggy for my laptop. Every time I typed, it would take triple the amount of time for the words to show up on the page. That was very frustrating because I had to take much longer completing each section than I planned for. 

If I could do this project differently, I would maybe try to use a different platform to host my story but I also don't know any other platforms but I can try to look for other ones. I felt like the whole process I was just getting frustrated with Shorthand.
